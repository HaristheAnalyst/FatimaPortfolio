#Call Centre Trends Visualising customer and agent behaviour.
##Creating a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for Claire that reflects various relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics can provide a clear overview of performance. Below, I'll outline the structure of the dashboard, including potential KPIs and metrics:
•	Overall customer satisfaction Overall calls answered/abandoned 
•	Calls by time Average 
•	speed of answer Agent’s performance quadrant -> 
•	average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

The above dashboard provides Claire with a holistic view of call center performance, agent productivity,and customer satisfaction. It enables her to identify trends, areas for improvement, and top-performing agents.he interactivity and drill-down options empower her to explore data in detail, making informed decisions to optimize call center operations.
